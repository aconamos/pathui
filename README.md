# TODO
## Essential
- [ ] Write the changes to env
- [x] Refine layout
- [x] Add instructions to bottom (use a block around the whole thing?) (instructions change based on mode)
- [x] Add modified indicator
- [ ] Add functionality to write to multiple places
- [ ] Write menu should ask for confirmation
- [x] Editing logic should probably be confined to inside select_menu?
- [x] Ability to MOVE the PATH items
- [x] DEFINITELY refactor this shit. This is really terrible code
- [ ] Make commands to load from a pathfile, query a pathfile, find a binary using a pathfile (which functionality), etc

## Non-essential
- [ ] Add collapsible sidebar to show what binaries are now available in PATH
- [ ] Mouse support for choosing a path item to edit

## Feedback
- Checkmarks are weird, lol. What does activating a path mean?
